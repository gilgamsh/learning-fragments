# Quantitative Trading Algorithm Research Guidelines

## Research Process
1. Data Acquisition & Cleaning: Use high-quality financial data, handle missing values and outliers
2. Feature Engineering: Create predictive features including technical indicators, fundamental data, and market sentiment; pay attention to both volume and price changes
3. Strategy Development: Design trading signal generation logic with entry/exit conditions
4. Backtesting Framework: Validate strategy performance using historical data, calculate key metrics
5. Risk Management: Implement stop-loss mechanisms, position sizing, and portfolio optimization
6. Execution Optimization: Reduce slippage, optimize trade timing and order management

## Code Structure
- data/: Raw and processed market data
- features/: Feature generation and processing
- strategies/: Trading strategy implementations
- backtesting/: Backtesting engine and evaluation tools
- risk/: Risk management components
- execution/: Order execution logic
- utils/: General utility functions
- config/: Configuration parameters and constants

## Key Performance Metrics
- Annualized return, maximum drawdown, Sharpe ratio
- Win rate, profit factor, expected return
- Trading frequency, holding period distribution
- Alpha and beta coefficients
- Transaction cost sensitivity analysis

## Coding Best Practices
- Use vectorized operations for efficiency
- Document strategy logic and parameters thoroughly
- Implement parameter optimization while avoiding overfitting
- Design modular components for reusability and testing
- Use version control to track strategy iterations
