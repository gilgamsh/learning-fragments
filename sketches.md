Life is too short for us to experience the colourful world. I did believe that humans should think twice and live once, but sometimes thinking too much seemed a waste of time and making the right decision at the perfect time was just nonsense.So I changed myself, preferring doing something rather than thinking about something. I started to roll the dice and let god control the fate of my life. I was assured that life is a play and I am just a role. 

After a long time, I met you @Wendy, my pretty, charming, and stunning girl. I did not doubt that you were my girl when I first saw you. You were like a goddess coming from heaven, intruding on my mind.
I didn't run after you too purposely, but destiny brought us together and we shared our lives with each other and went through the difficult time.
I was so happy to see and know you. I was so happy that you were in my life and change it forever. It was hard for me to imagine the possible trajectories if you didn't come into my life.

Glad to have another Tanabata with you.
