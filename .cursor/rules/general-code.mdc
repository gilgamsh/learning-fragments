# General Code Style Guidelines

## Core Principles
- Write self-documenting code with minimal inline comments
- Focus on code clarity and expressiveness
- Use semantic naming conventions

## Language Requirements
- All code and comments must be written in English
- Communication with developers can be in Chinese (中文)
- No Chinese characters allowed in code or comments

## Implementation Guidelines
- Choose descriptive variable and function names that explain their purpose
- Structure code in a way that makes its intent clear
- Break down complex operations into well-named functions
- Use comments only when code clarity alone is insufficient
