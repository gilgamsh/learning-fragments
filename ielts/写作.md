1. Introduction
The line graph compares the amount of electricity produced in France using four different sources of power over a period of 32 years.
2. Overview 2 sentences 2 main points
It's obvious that nuclear power was by far the most important means of electricity production over the period shown. Renewables provided the lowest amount of electricity in each year.
3. Details 1 (根据时间划分details两段)
In 1980,  the thermal power stations provided the most amount of electricity production in France, generating around 120 terawatt hours of power each year. Nuclear and hydroelectric power stations produced just under 75 terawatt hours of electricity each, and renewables provided a negligible amount.  Just one year later, unclear power overtook thermal power becoming the primary source of power.
4. Details 2
Between 1980 and 2005,  electricity production from nuclear power rose dramatically to a peak of 430 terawatt hours. By contrast, the figure for thermal powers fell to only 50 terawatt hours in 1985 and remained at this level for the rest of the period. Hydroelectric power generation remained relatively stable, at between 50 and 80 terawatt hours, for the whole 32-years period, but renewable electricity production saw only a small rise to approximately 25 terawatt hours by 2012.

### Pie Charts

相同点 不同点
1. Introduction
The pie charts compare five categories of household expenditure in the UK and New Zealand in the years 1980 and 2008.
2. Overview 2 sentences 2 main points
It is noticeable that the proportion of spending on food and drink fell in both countries over the 28-year period, while spending on utility bills rose. Also, UK residents spent a significantly larger percentage of their household budgets on leisure than their New Zealand counterparts.
3. Details 1
In 1980, 29% of an average New Zealand household budget went on food and drink, while the equivalent figure for a UK home was 23%. By 2008, expenditure on food and drink had fallen by 4% in New Zealand, and by 10% in the UK. By contrast, both countries saw an increase in expenditure on utility bills for the average home, from 27% to 31% in New Zealand and from 26% to 28% in the UK.
4. Details 2
Leisure activities accounted for the highest proportion of UK household spending in both years, but only the third highest proportion in New Zealand. In fact, in 2008, New Zealanders spent only half as much in relative terms on (17%) as UK residents (34%). In both countries, transport costs and other costs took roughly 15% and 10% of household budgets respectively.

### Tables
First, look for main or general features. Second, describe specific numbers.
1. Introduction
The table compares the five highest ranking countries in terms of the numbers of visits and the money spent by tourists over a period of two years.
2. Overview 2 sentences 2 main points
It is clear that France was the world's most popular tourist destination in the years 2012 and 2013. However, the USA earned by far the most revenue from tourism over the same period.

### Two different charts

First, look for one main feature in each chart. 
Second, describe specific numbers for each chart separately.

1. Introduction
The bar chart compares the numbers of males and females who took four different evening classes in 2009, and the pie chart shows the age profile of these attendees.
2. Overview 2 sentences 2 main points
It is clear that significantly more women than men attended evening classes at the education centre. We can also see that evening courses were much more popular among older adults.
3. Details 1
**According to the bar chart**, drama, painting and language courses, all attracted more women than men to the education centre in 2009. Language classes had the highest number of participants overall, with 40 female and 20 male students, while the painting was a popular choice among both genders, attracting 30 female and 25 male attendees. The only course with a higher number of males was sculpture, but this course was taken by a mere 15 people in total.

### Process diagram

1. Introduction
The first flow diagram illustrates the process of glass container production, and the second diagram shows steps in the process of recycling used glass.
2. Overview 2 sentences 2 main points
We can see that glass is made using three main materials, and that the manufacturing process consists of four distinct stages. It requires five steps to turn used glass into new glass products.
3. Details 1
At the first stage in the production of glass, sand, soda ash, limestone and other chemicals are mixed together. Next, this mixture is heated in a glass furnace at approximately 1500℃ to produce molten glass. The molten glass can then be shaped, by blowing, to create the end products, namely glass containers. 
4. Details 2
Glass recycling begins with the collection of used glass products. The collected glass is sorted according to its colour and then washed in order to remove any impurities. In the fourth stage of recycling, the glass is crushed and melted, and the resulting molten glass can finally be moulded to create new items.

### Comparison diagram

Describe the **changes and things that don't change**.
Describe the **difference and similarities**.

1. Introduction
The two pictures compare the current layout of the ground floor of a house with a plan to redesign the same living space.
2. Overview 2 sentences 2 main points
We can see that the new design proposal involves making a number of changes to the ground floor of the house, mainly in the central hall area. There are no plans to change external walls or entrances.
3. Details 1
The most noticeable change from the existing to the proposed floor plan is that there will no longer be a separate hall area when the building work has been done. This will be achieved by removing the internal wall and door between the hall and living room, along with the current stairs and understairs storage. With no separate hall area, the proposed living room will also contain the staircase to the first floor.
4. Details 2
To replace the current straight staircase, a new set of winding stairs will be installed in the corner of the living room. The internal door between the hall and kitchen will also be replaced with double doors connecting the kitchen with the new living room. Finally, the planned building work will also include the installation of some kitchen furniture.

lt is sometimes argued that high school students should be made to do some work in their local communities. 
I completely agree with this kind of scheme would be a good idea.
In my opinion, it would be wrong to force teenagers to do any kind of unsalaried work.
**While** l disagree with the idea of making such programmes compulsory, **l do believe** that voluntary communmty service could benefit young people.

 Idea, Explain, Example (one idea , a reason, an opinion)

some people believe that unpaid community service should be a compulsory part of high school shuoprogrammes.
To what extent do you agree or disagree?

 3-minute plan:
- disagree for several reasons
- school timetable is full, no time for community service
- students' work in other subjects would be affected
- teenagers might not want to do it (reluctant, no motivation)

There are several reasons why l would argue against having compulsory community service for secondary school students.
**Firstly**, the school curriculum is already full with important academic subjects,such as maths,science and language.
For example, i remember having an extremely busy timetable when l was at high school, and it would not
have been possible to add to it.**Secondly**,students' performance in other subjects would be affected if valuable study time were taken
by charity work or neighbourhood improvement schemes.**Finally**, l believe that teenage students would be reluctant to
take part in any programme of obligatory work,and this could lead to poor motivation and even bad behaviour.

3-minute plan:

- voluntary (not compulsory) community service is positive
- students more motivated if they can choose
- gain work experience, self confidence,skills
- good for CVs, career, university admissions, employers

On the other hand, the opportunity to do voluntary community service could be extremely positive for high school students. By
making these programmes optional,schools would ensure that only motivated students took part.These young people would gain valuable experience in an adult working environment, which could help to build their self confidence and enhance their skills. Having such experience and skills on their CVs could greatly improve school leavers' career prospects. **For example**, a period of voluntary work experience might impress a university admissions officer or a future employer.
