- if there is a double number, we say “double 7”
- we don’t say the numbers one by one, rather we read them in groups of 2 or 3. So 13554684616 would be said “13-double 5 – 468-46-16”

一、听力

1.第1，4篇比较简单，尽量全对，第一篇直接，主要是一些专有名词，人名，地名，电话号码等，注意大小写（月份，人名，地名）还有单复数

第4篇也是听关键词，但是要考验整体句型理解能力，注意有时候答案句段可能出现在关键词前（难）

2，3篇较难，多为地图、流程题

方法：剑桥雅思真题练习，BBC6分钟补充训练

二、阅读

1.时间据难易程度，长度分配：第一篇10～13min，第二篇13～15min，第三篇半小时
前两篇全对
2.方法：

A.关键词定位，标记找答案；人名 名词 时间 

B.注意T/F/N或者Y/N写全；

C.如果题干说有选项用到2次，大概率会有选项用到2次；

D.T/F/N分配个数均匀

E.某个人说的话，做标记便于查找

三、写作

simon老师（b站），grammarly(可纠正语法错误）

小作文：

注意点：时态，拼写

类型：折线图，描述数据变化规律，地图，流程图

主要掌握：比较句型，描述上升下降句型

大作文：

四段式：开头，中间两段观点（正反），结尾（总结）

注意点：连词

方法：背作文模版，按照不同类型，手写

四、口语

1.资料：Keithspeakingacademy.com

雅思哥口语题材库

2.要求：能听懂问题，能按照套路回答问题，流利不卡壳。（个人建议多用英式表达）

3.技巧：part1:简单，表达观点+原因  3+4+4 3个关于学习工作生活  show fluency answer quickly
使用完整句子，
Part2:注意时间，2min，可以备好一个故事，但是注意铺垫不要过长，根据考官问题调整语序，抛出得分点。方法是背模版+自己的题材

Part3:逻辑同大作文。Y or N(观点）+例子支撑，可以分为正反两方观点回答（这个问题我认为是。。。因为。。。，但是也有其他人不这么认为，原因是。。。）

4.注意点：时态的运用，高级语法得分点会更高，注意考官问问题的时态。（保证正确前提）

5.方法：

A.录音，回顾自己说的内容，看是否有错误。

B.找水平相当的同伴练习，增加流利度自然度

C.背了模版后根据口语题材库进行回答训练，如果无法套用模版的再思考填充内容

五、备考：

1.备考时间2个月，3h/day，一套真题，分析错误。真题做透前提再去做其他资料，

2.先熟悉雅思试题，然后一篇听力一篇阅读，后一个月1.2倍速听，卡点练习时间，总结错题。错点如同义词转换，记录记忆高频出现考点。
