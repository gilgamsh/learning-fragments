## Listen

### Section 1

#### Telephone Number 
0 is pronounced “oh” and you are most unlikely to hear “zero”
- if there is a double number, we say “double 7”
- we don’t say the numbers one by one, rather we read them in groups of 2 or 3. So 13554684616 would be said “13-double 5 – 468-46-16”
